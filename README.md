### Arrow DragonSense

The DragonSense project demonstrates the DragonBoard&trade; acting as a sensor gateway. Paired with Texas Instruments SensorTags using Bluetooth BLE, you can connect as many sensors as you want. Available sensor data includes, but not limited to IR thermopile temperature, 9-axis motion, digitial humidity, altimeter/pressure, ambient light, buzzer, magnet sensor, and digital microphone. Every couple of seconds, a client application written using the Amazon IoT JS SDK
uses MQTT to transfer the event to an Amazon data center where it is stored in a DynamoDB table.

The functionality of DragonSense and how the application is configured is
detailed.  The documentation includes information on how to execute the client
and visit the dashboard.
